# Beer Recommender System
## Problem Statement
Can we recommend a beer type to you based on your preference in taste, aroma, appearance, and even your palate? 

Original [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rdoume/beerreviews?select=beer_reviews.csv) was downloaded from Kaggle.
The dataset includes a large variety of unique beers that were rated from thousands of unique users. Users rated each beer based on the following criteria: 
- Aroma
- Palate
- Taste
- Appearance
- Overall Rating

Each category can be rated anywhere between 1 (bad, not good, not preferred) and 5 (good, preferred). 

The output will be about 5-7 beer recommendations based on the criteria provided (above).
