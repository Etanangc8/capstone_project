18,Tradewinds is a great beer that hits a lot of good notes. Seems to hold up well too.,beer
19,"I disagree.  Sour in the Rye is probably one of my least favorite beers from them, but pretty much anything else in their Terreux/sour lineup is good or better overall.  If you find Rueuze, I would HIGHLY suggest picking it up, as it is quite good.  I still have one bottle of the 2015 in my cellar currently.",beer
20,"One of the places I visit had a similar sale a few years ago.  Picked up a Trade Winds tripel that was two years old and enjoyed it very much.  Stouts and other dark beers are normally the only beers I'd go that old with, but for five bucks I figured I'd give it a shot and was pleasantly surprised. The 8.6% ABV might have  helped it keep, or at least buzz me to ambivalence.

Sours and farmhouse stuff that old is taking a gamble, but if five bucks going down the drain won't bother you I say roll the dice on something that sounds interesting.  Just don't judge the brewery or the style based on that sample.",beer

34,Any tricks on pouring from a crowler without spilling? I tend to sip out the first couple ounces but still end up spilling a lot of the time on first/subsequent pours until the crowler is about half full. I'm pouring quickly and with confidence (old kitchen advice) but it seems no matter what I do there is always some minor loss.,beer
35,"Short answer......  ""All Of Them"" 

Then decide for yourself what YOU like.  Seriously. Use UnTappd or similar to keep track of your tastings and try as many as you can find. You will soon figure out what YOU like in a beer.",beer
36,"I don’t think so. I’ve never heard of that happening. I would go with a bad can. Though, it could have been what you ate. Recently, I discovered Skittles are a pallet killer (don’t ask), so it could be with what you had prior to drinking it that killed the taste. 

I’d say judge off another six pack with the following parameters;

Pour into glass
Straight from can
Food before with no cleanser
Food before with cleanser
No food before


Obviously, those can be combined. But congratulations! You now have a quarantine or post quarantine (no idea where you are, can’t make assumptions) science experiment!

There is also the argument of freshness of the beer. With IPA’s I tend to go off the 90 day rule, while I try to purchase IPA’s as fresh as possible, sometimes it can’t be helped and we all love what we love regardless of age (ferda). 

Whichever way you choose, I hope you get your answer!",beer

38,"I don't want to get too political, or possibly banned, but if a certain leader of the country this bar is located in had actually taken the virus seriously back in January, things wouldn't be so bad or dystopian now.

41,"More than likely coagulated proteins, called 'beer floaties,' with maybe a bit of yeast and other particles falling out of solution, mixed in. Beer floaties are often darkish in darker beers.

They are harmless to drink. If you have any doubt, you can simply decant them off.

Beer floaties are common in beers with a bit of age on them (like this one) and ones what haven't been through high levels of filtration.

Great beer, by the way.",beer
42,"I honestly wouldn’t bother moving them to a second location. Just keep them at room temperature for 2 or 3 weeks. Ive always found 1 week gets you some carbonation, two weeks gets you mostly carbonated, and 3 weeks will have you fully carbonated unless something went wrong.",beer

57,"Elder Pine has a really easy pre-order and pick-up. You can access the ordering process on their website--[the homepage](https://www.elderpine.com/home) also has info on upcoming releases. 

Of their currently available cans I've had Call of the Void, a very clean IPA, and Neighborly and Steward of the Elements (which I'm currently drinking), both solid but not exceptional lagers. 

Of the crowlers, Astrid is good but drinks more like an amber than anything I'd describe as a farmhouse, Farmhouse at Midnight is not quite a saison yet is one of the most complex beers I've had in a while with chocolate and dark fruit notes, L'appel Du Vide is made with the same grain and hops as Call of the Void but uses their farmhouse yeast producing a very different flavor profile (it is also great), and their standard Pilsner is simply incredible, crisp with a fresh hop flavor. 

If it means anything, I think Elder Pine has a very high floor and they're one of the best breweries we consistently get in DC. I recently stocked up when I was out there visiting the Rachel Carson Conservation Park, which is worth walking around if you have a little time and like to get outdoors--Elder Pine is adjacent to the Conservation's parking lot.

Let me know if you plan to go through Silver Spring or DC or your journey, I'd be happy to point you in the right direction on where to go. 

Enjoy Sapwood and Elder Pine, both are great choices for the area.",beer

I don't take the kid to breweries so he can sit around bored as shit while mom and dad have a brew.

Meanwhile the kids can’t be left alone at all and 9/10 of them somehow make total nuisances of themselves the entire  time their parents are there, but they still have the strongest claim for being there.",beer

I would also suggest checking out Oktoberfest in Brighton Beach, I was able to find Edlestoff quite a few times, even on tap one lucky time.

There is no ALE or LAGER flavour.

Ales and lagers can be light or dark in colour, light or heavy in flavour, sweet or bitter, high or low in abv.

Basically, beer can be broken down to :

\- 2 families, ALE and LAGER.

\- 2 families are based on being top-fermented (ALE) and bottom-fermented (LAGER).

\- the difference between the families is the yeast.

\- there are many different strains of LAGER yeast, saccharomyces pastorianus.

\- most of the beer sold in the worlds and the biggest beer names, Bud, Corona, Heineken, etc. are all commercial pale lagers.

\- there are even more different strains of ALE yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae.

\- Ales dominate the craft beer scene.

\- within each family, there are lots of different styles, [https://www.brewersassociation.org/edu/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/](https://www.brewersassociation.org/edu/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/) [https://www.bjcp.org/docs/2015\_Guidelines\_Beer.pdf](https://www.bjcp.org/docs/2015_Guidelines_Beer.pdf)

\- the difference between each style comes down to the ingredients that are used and how they are used.

There are obviously some beers/styles that buck these basics, like those with mixed fermentation or styles which a mixed history and have been known to use both yeasts.",beer

211,"The history of the Baltic Porter isn't as clean and simple as people thing.

Back in the day, breweries in the Baltic states and other cold regions wanted to make a porter, like the ones coming out of London.

Due to their cold environment, German lager production techniques were often used, including lager yeast, which does better in cooler climates. 

Whether they sought to use bottom-fermenting yeasts is unclear, given yeast was a relatively unknown factor, with yeast not being a factor until the latter part of the 1800's, early 1900's.

There is some evidence to show they thought they were just making normal porter, having no idea after the yeast they were using.

For most, especially new world breweries, lager yeast is the defining factor, because of its clean ferment.

Some traditional Baltic Porter brewers use ale yeast and something about it being a requirement in Russia to use ale yeast.

I stand to be corrected in what I have written, as it's a messy history, a bit like that of IPA's.",beer

221,"Corny kegs are very standard for homebrew and small breweries because they can be cleaned and filled by hand or using very cheap equipment. Your kegerator probably just has a standard 5lb co2 cylinder that can actually be a bit tricky to deal with. Most places don’t refill tanks on site, they only do swaps. The new tank also has to be inspected and pressure tested which can be a pain to have done. It’s usually easier to just do swaps like with grilling propane. Unless you know there is a place nearby that will refill a tank it also ends up being cheaper considering travel distance.

Your kegerator probably comes with a sanke coupler for commercial kegs but can very easily and cheaply be adapted to accept a corny as well. Two short lengths of hose, four screw tight hose clamps, and two plastic MFL connectors should do it.",beer

They don’t have a full canning line yet so they’re just doing small batch mini-crowlers, mostly. Black Flag and Hysteria are both only a few minutes away and should have a better selection. It would be easy to knock out those three at once.

Sapwood did have a big can release this weekend and they said they’re probably releasing mixed 4pks of the stragglers that didn’t sell on Tuesday for pickup on Wednesday (of this week, not next week).

Old Tom’s is a favorite of mine and I was a bit disappointed when I visited a Robinson’s tied pub in Manchester and they didn’t have any bottles. You don’t see it in the states very often.

I’ve found that beer with flavoring added loses that flavoring over time, so your experience with Old Tom isn’t so surprising. I attempted to age Anchor Christmas Ale, and I was similarly disappointed.

I have had more great success with aging any beer that has been bottle conditioned, or had yeast and/or brewing sugar added when it was bottled. I’m guessing that isn’t the case with Old Tom. In 2004, I found four magnums of Chimay Bleu in a liquor store that was vintage dated 1979. I knew the buyer and he said that he found them in a warehouse, so I took the chance and bought all four. I’ve opened them all for special occasions and they were all magnificent. I’ve also had some spectacular failures (I tried aging a saison that exploded upon opening), but significantly more successes so don’t give up on aging beers!

From what I’ve read, beer won’t age as well in a refrigerator because any residual yeast will not be as active, or may even become dormant. I age my beer in a cool, dirt floor cellar where the temperature remains consistently in the 60’s year round.

BTW: I have a Teku glass like yours that I bought at the BrewDog in Manchester. I initially thought that the glasses were a bit much, but after a couple sessions at La Fin Mousse where all they have are Teku, I learned to love them.

279,"Lots of good advice here. To reiterate:

1)you’ll get about forty 16oz pours from a 1/6 accounting for loss from foam and what not.

2) your Jai Alai also should be good for about 3 months. ( check your keg date on the collar)

3) beer shelf life is subjective. If it’s kept cold and co2 is used to push, you should be okay. Beer changes from day 1 and so forth but it doesn’t mean it’s bad. The flavors may change such and Maltiness, bitterness, hop aroma etc. but it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad yet. It won’t get you sick if that’s your concern. I find it interesting to see how a beer changes over time and figure out what I don’t like when a beer gets old or if I still think it’s good regardless of age.

4) also if you don’t finish the keg it’s totally okay to return to the brewery with some beer left in it. No one will judge or care for that matter.

If you’re not getting hazy, juice-bomb, hop hash NEIPA’s and are buying your more traditional West Coast or American IPA’s you’ll be fine. 

Also, I’m assuming you’ll be getting beers other than just IPA’s... so don’t base your whole decision on that. The real decision should be how many taps you want. I’d strongly recommend two or three. You don’t have to have beer on all of them... flavored seltzers, homemade sodas, kombucha... the list goes on and on with things you can put on tap besides beer.",beer
299,"Yup. I also do ""Bud equivalents"" as ratios.

So 8%/5% is 1.6 ""Buds"" and a pint over 12oz is 1.3 ""Buds"". So an 8% 16oz-er is 1.3 x 1.6 strength Buds or 2.08 Buds.

A 16.9oz 15% Bourbon County stout bottle is 1.4 x strength of 3 Buds, or 4.2 Buds in one.

A 12oz 8% beer, however, would leave 48 units in your blood after one hour, getting you 4x as intoxicated as the 5% beer while less than doubling the abv.

The beer scene in Central MD keeps improving while RAR has slipped since they lost their head brewer last year. Burley has remained stagnant and still has the quality control issues they've always had but never bothered to fix because their beer sells out anyway. The Jreams aren't anything special with so many other places nearby making similar fruited kettle sours now, and their IPAs are legit bad. If you're going to the beach/coast anyway and that's why you want to stop at RAR and Burley, then it might be worth it, but even then, I highly recommend going to Dewey instead or at least in addition; it's better than both of them.",beer

83,"Hello fellow spork.


I usually estimate 37 16oz beers per log when purchasing for bar, as there will some spillage, foam, and some left in the log that cannot be pushed out without additional fluid in the log.

Generally, an ipa will go bad after about three months - assuming you got it fresh. Be sure to check the date on the log to determine how old it is to begin with. I'm in Connecticut, and generally speaking, cigar city logs and half barrels are at least a month old when I receive them.

$90 is highway robbery for a log of jai alai. I pay $72, which is directly from the distributor, but that seems like a high mark up. Might I suggest possibly going directly to some local breweries, or perhaps shopping around a bit to other liquor stores? 

You will also likely pay a deposit on the actual log itself. It depends how much, but generally it's about 20-30 here, depending on the distributor. When you return the log, you'll receive that money back, or just use it as credit toward your next log. 

You cannot return out of code already tapped logs. You can return the log if it's untapped though, since the outlet you're purchasing from can then return that to distributor at no additional cost. You can return out of code cans as well, generally not too difficult to do, but again it depends on the outlet you're dealing with directly and whether or not they are willing to reach out to distributor.",beer

One thing no one else seems to have said to you is that because kegs are so well sealed and have so little oxygen in to begin with, they tend to keep longer than other storage methods (although modern canning systems are probably getting up there). There's 0 need to worry about you and your fiance going through a sixtel in time, I take down a pony of IPA (1/4 barrel) myself without ever noticing the beer going bad.

One thing you can do if you're worried about it, though, is just pick styles that are less sensitive to age. IPAs will obviously fade faster than, say, a Pilsner. But I genuinely wouldn't worry about it with two people drinking a sixtel, I doubt you'll notice any difference between the first and last pour unless you're really dragging it out.

139,"It sounds counter-intuitive but maybe try turning your gas pressure up.

Sometimes is the pressure of the CO2 going into the keg is too low, there isn't enough head pressure to the CO2 in the beer in solution, mean the beer pour frothy. By slightly increasing the incoming CO2 pressure, it can force the CO2 back into the solution.

Check seal and joins for leaks. 

Check internal temperature of the unit and the serving temperature of the poured beer. If there is too bigger difference, insulate the lines. 

""Burn"" the first bit until the beer pours clear, as it can often cause excess foam in the glass. This can also be foamy because it has become warmer.

141,"A 1/6 bbl keg is 5.2 gallons. Which is 41.6 sixteen ounce glasses of beer. You have 3 months before a Pale Ale like Jai Alai starts to seriously lose flavor. You could have a beer every other day and you'd still be alright.

All that said, I'm super jealous. The kegerator at my last place belonged to my roomate, and I don't have room for one here. When you get your first keg in there post pics so I can live vicarously through you!",beer
142,"Lol right.

To be honest 1 beer per day on average is completely fine health wise, as long as you are conscious of the calories that means you are adding.

Hell, I’ve seen studies that say 2-3 drinks per day is fine as far as alcohol intake goes.",beer
143,drink more than one beer.,beer
144,"how insulated is your fluid line? that foot that runs up the tower is sitting warm usually. If you pour the first two seconds into a glass then hot swap in a new glass do you notice a difference in the opacity of the beer?  This is usually temperature related or you're faucet has a gate issue like other homey mentioned.  Turn that pressure down low, 8-10psi will do just fine",beer

148,"Pabst Blue Ribbon is sort of similar.  
  
Asahi beer that you can commonly get in the US is actually brewed by Molsons, so it's pretty much similar. So I do enjoy Asahi, but the actually imported ones from Japan is different and really good as well in my opinion (dryer taste), just harder to come by.",beer
149,"Did you ever find a close match?  I have the same question as you.  Molson Golden is being carried at fewer and fewer liquor stores &amp; I’m hoping to prepare for the day it disappears completely.  The closest I’ve found is Mile High City Copper Lager by Breckenridge Brewery.  It’s a little sweeter, a little more bitter, and has a little less barley up front, but it’s as close as I’ve found.",beer
150,Just buy kegs of barleywine and you'll never have to worry. You may also go completely broke but that's a risk I'm willing to take.,beer
151,"Got it, good addendum",beer
152,"To give a couple quick rules of thumb: Beer is better fresh. The more hops in the beer, like a pale ale or IPA, it is better sooner. The more alcohol in the beer and the more dark grains used, the better it will age. Think barley wines or old ales or high percentage Belgians. Also, when brewers do not filter the yeast out of the beer, it will age better. 

The age limit on a beer has a lot of variables but typically, color and alcohol content can give you a good hint. 

I homebrew beer so my beers always age well since homebrewers have no means of filtering the yeast out of their beer. 

I wish you the best of luck with your kegerator! Prost!",beer
153,"Different breweries will have different best-by dates depending on the style of beer, or larger companies that are just in it for the money will slap something ridiculous like a six month best-by date.

So yes, it’s not an expiration date but the beer will be nothing as it should be after a month or two.",beer

From what I’ve read, non-pasteurized beer will last 3-6 weeks. But that’s not so much an expiration as it is a sort of sell by date?",beer
156,"If you hook your keg up to a bottle of CO2 then the beer won’t have an expiration date. The flavor may peak and then start to decline depending on the type of beer, but it will stay drinkable to whole time with no waste. I currently have a keg of Belgian Tripel that’s been on tap since late March and it is doing great!",beer

The exception is wine may be shipped to Delaware directly from the winery only if you are physically at the winery to purchase and ship it yourself.  For example, you can go tour Napa Valley and, up to some reasonable limit, purchase a case or so of wine to ship back home.

36,"Bud is only good when someone else has paid for it.  Like many mass produced beers (coors, miller lite, busch) it's a step above water and consumed in similar quantities.  Inoffensive because it's not a strong beer, but that may be why it has a pretty loyal fanbase in the states.  I have witnessed so many people dragged to a microbrewery or dedicated beer bar with 50+ taps and insist on ordering a bud light. It's fine on a hot summer day, but is so cheap in US stores, the price for a cold one at sporting events or restaurants is ludicrous. You can often buy a 6 pack or better for what they charge (why I suggest someone else pays for it).

The reason for this is that the strains of yeast and grains have changed significantly over the centuries. And while there have been effort to clone yeast from Egyptian archeological finds, it will likely never be economical to do the same for the grains.

151,"Marketing.

I noticed in your video you were pretty hung up on the dark ale vs porter vs stout idea.

Ale vs lager has a technical distinction: different yeasts.

Ale yeasts tend to thrive at higher temperatures and are often more aggressive. As a result, ales are brewed warm and can reach fairly high ABV.

Lager yeasts thrive at lower temperature and are generally less aggressive. This means that lagers are brewed cold and typically with lower malt content for a more subtle, crisp flavor.

Porter is a style of dark ale. The name descends from English brewing tradition. Dark ale, heavy in malt and therefore high in calories, was preferred by the river porters of England.

Stout is actually short for ""stout porter"". It just means like a porter, but stronger.

Dark ale is a general term that refers to any ale which is dark and heavy. The darkness comes from a high amount of roasted malt, and it lends itself to high ABV (more malt means more sugar for the yeast to convert to alcohol) high calories (sugars that remain unconverted) and generally a thicker, more syrupy mouthfeel.

Of course, 1554 is none of these. It's technically a lager, although an unusually heavy one. Lagers featuring roasted malts are often called ""black lagers"", and while that might qualify, black lagers typically have a lower original gravity (basically a weaker brew). They tend to be light and bitter.

I understand why New Belgium is struggling to find a term to describe this beer to potential drinkers. It's an odd duck.",beer
152,Kombucha does it for me. There’s this hop infused kombucha I really like.,beer
153,"Not having a go at the OP, but I really wish the beer industry would steer clear of calling session beers 'IPAs.' 

The idea of a 'session IPA' was only developed by brewery marketing teams to get in on the IPA hype from last decade. 

It has done nothing but muddy the water of what style is what. 

And, yes styles do evolve, but this isn't evolution, it's the hijacking a styles name. 

IPAs, at least in this current craft beer revolution, were bigger, bolder, higher abv. pale ales. 

Someone new to beers finds Founders All Day IPA and loves it. They walk up to the bar and say, ""I love IPA's!"" Then they try Sierra Nevada Torpedo and can't finish it. They are confused about what an IPA is. True story. 

It's like saying, ""I brewed this 5% Russian Imperial session Stout."" No, you brewed a stout!

Long answer - Yes, but with some added info.

There is a difference in a beer tasting bad and being unsafe.

Beer has 'Best before' dates, not 'Expiration dates.'

'Best before' refers to food items that shouldn't pose any danger to humans, irrespective of how old they are. The dates are used producers to indicate when they think the product should be consumed by, to enjoy it in a fresh state.

On the other hand, 'Expiration date' are attached to food items that have a very real likelihood of developing pathogens that are dangerous/deadly to humans. These are more likely to be animal-based products, meat, milk, eggs, etc.

There is a difference in a beer tasting bad and being unsafe. Beer changes with age, with most beers tasting worse, the older they get. This doesn't make them unsafe.

Generally, there is nothing about beer that makes it unsafe to drink, irrespective of how old it is.

I say generally, as there are pathogens that can survive in beer and be harmful, but they are incredibly rare issues, mostly coming to do with grain and in the brewery, not if a beer is old.

Techniques and technology for both grain production and brewery sanitation/testing have greatly reduced the chances of exposure to these pathogens.

Mould can still grow in beer, beyond what happened in the brewery, and would be the most likely cause of concern. This might be as a result of a dirty bottle, poor closure (cork or crown seal) allowing ingress, etc.

If a finished, packaged beer has mould in it, I probably wouldn't drink it, irrespective of its age.

But don't confuse mould with coagulated proteins/yeast, referred to as 'beer floaties.' Beer floaties are harmless. If in doubt, throw it out, but take some pics and post them.

Like any food product, there is still a remote chance of beer being unsafe. There are pathogens all around us in our day to day lives. I'd be more concerned about the bread that is a few days old and is the perfect breeding ground for mould, rather than an old beer.

TL;DR - A beer being old doesn't make it unsafe.

It's a complex topic and well above my pay grade.",beer

187,"It generally takes a brewery about a day to brew wort (i.e. beer before yeast has been added).

It then takes yeast anywhere from about 1 to 12 weeks to ferment the beer, depending on the style.

The reason you need multiple fermenters is bc breweries are typically brewing wort multiple times a week (most I know brew 5 or 6 times - so 5 or 6 days, then the other 1 or 2 days are for bottling or canning). 

Without multiple fermenters - you could only make 1 batch of pale ale every 2 weeks for example - vs say 10 batches of pale ale in the same amount of time with more fermenters.

If a brewery conditions their beer in separate vessels after fermentation, they may have multiple conditioning vessels. Most common are brite tanks - but fewer brite tanks would be used than fermenters because the beer doesn't have to sit for as long in them.

There are always exceptions to the rules tho.

If you have any other questions like this, r/thebrewery would be the best place to ask probably. r/homebrewing you could ask stuff there too - but while some homebrewing stuff translates to pro brewing, a WHOLE lot doesn't - just be aware.",beer

But....the beers aren't good. They just had the fortune of making the JREAMs a year or two before the style took off. They're still living off that reputation even though there are dozens of breweries doing it much better than they are.

They have serious issues with refermentation and foaming/exploding cans (even more so than other places that make similar fruited beers). They've had a few IPAs recently that clearly had something going wrong in the canning process because they were either wildly undercarbed, tasted like they had about a year's worth of oxidation after a few weeks, or were just an undrinkable mess of hop burn.

They've also had pricing errors where a beer was advertised for one price and they charged hundreds of people a few bucks extra per 4pk on release day. Keeping in mind many of those people may not even have receipts because the majority of their customers on release day pay cash, because they have a ludicrous 9% charge added to credit card transactions (which they almost never actually mention or warn people about).

The list goes on and on. The ABV issues were just the latest example of them being lazy or downright shady. Unfortunately they have no motivation to improve their quality control or business practices because everything still sells out.",beer

I wonder what Guinness would taste like if it was pumped from a firkin in the cellar under no pressure like an English bitter. I’ve heard that the advantage of nitrogen is mostly the perceived smoothness in texture or “mouthfeel”, but I’ve also read that nitrogen can sublimate the sharp edges of the taste components so you don’t get all of the possible complexities. The nitro version is so damn good though. There was an old advertising slogan about drinking your pint of Guinness in four gulps.

The beers OP mentioned are lagers so maybe start with those, adding pilsners. Then look into the lighter wheat beers like hefe weizen, maybe try a farmhouse or saison and see if he likes that. Then get into the hops, pale ale and IPA. Then go dark, try browns, porters, stouts. Then switch it up and go for a sour beer! That's usually an acquired taste though. But so are hops so who knows.

* Lagers/pilsners
* Lighter wheat or Belgian ales (hefe weizen, farmhouse/saison, wit, Belgian strong, tripel)
* Pale ales/IPAs (make sure you explore the vast difference between West Coast and NE IPAs!)
* Brown, Amber, Red ales, dark wheat/Belgian (dunkel weizen, doppelbock, Belgian dubbel/quad)
* Porters, Stouts
* Sours!

There are many many more but these are the mains ones to start with, most every beer style is an offshoot or combination of these. Of course there are exceptions even to that but you gotta start somewhere.",beer

It basically gets “dry” and stops functioning and now she is on dialysis and waiting for a transplant. By the way, age doesn’t matter because she is 31 years old. GO SEE A NEPHROLOGIST ASAP!!!

Any one of the ingredients could responsible for the compound causing the issues.

Other factors can also come into play, like your level of hydration, foods you have eaten, your mood, sleep quality, etc.

98,"My best suggestion? You seem like you want to learn. Don't bother going to a beer store yet. Get on google, and find a couple of local breweries in your neighborhood (or area).

Go there, and sit at the bar.

Order a flight of beer. Flights generally are 3 to 6 pours that are often 3-6oz, just depends on the brewery. Almost all will offer some version of a flight. Tell the bartender that you are new to this, and just want to try new styles of beers. They will help guide you through this and give you a good range.

Now, you have some new styles down, did you like any of them? Great, take notes on that.

Now, if you didn't like some styles, don't just assume you don't like that style. It could be that brewery that you just didn't like theirs.

This is why I recommend going to another brewery and do the exact same thing. They likely will have some new beers, new styles, etc that you haven't had.

Do this for a couple of breweries. If you start noticing a trend of styles you like and don't like, you are now on your way to knowing what you should try from a store.

Now, you can go to a local beer store (I highly recommend a local craft store that specializes in beer...). Yes, it likely will be more expensive than a grocery store, but the store people should be able to help you with the shopping. Tell them what styles you like, and you want to try some new beers. They should be able to give you some suggestions. Many shops will sell single cans, so this will be an easy way to try a bunch of the available beers in your area of a style you like. You may find some new breweries, and can go check out their taproom when you get the chance (another reason you may want to ask for more local beer).

Isn't that part of the style?

How many people are after a West Coast IPA without bitterness?

&gt;to the extent that none of the other ingredients are even detectible. Interesting yeast esters?  Malt terroir? Actual hop aromas?

How many people are after a malt driven West Coast IPA?

How many people are after a yeast driven West Coast IPA?

I wonder how many people perceive little hop aroma from a fresh West Coast IPA?

Scotch Ale are terrible. Change my mind! Scotch Ales are always so malty, not having enough hop aroma and bitterness  Geez, I wish I had a huge amount of bitterness and massive hop aroma in my Scotch Ale. Are you the kind of person that goes into a nice steakhouse and insists on a well done steak? Cool. I've got a killer Scotch Ale you should try. It tastes malty. You'll love it! Why are Scotch ales always so malt-driven? This isn't a style. It's brewing laziness and it's disrespectful to the water and hops.

Hefeweizen are terrible. Change my mind! Hefeweizen are always so yeasty.  Geez, I wish I had a huge amount of bitterness in my Hefeweizen. Are you the kind of person that goes into a nice steakhouse and insists on a well done steak? Cool. I've got a killer Hefeweizen you should try. It tastes like bananas and cloves. You'll love it!

158,"Let's have a look at the body of your post.

&gt;No matter how hard West Coast breweries try to distinguish their IPAs from one another, the overwhelming bitterness so common to the style steamrolls over any subtleties or nuances of any of the ingredients - hops included.

Personal opinion/statement, no question.

&gt;Hell, you could literally make a beer of literally any style but boil more hops than you should longer than you should and poof! it's magically a West Coast IPA.

Personal opinion/statement, no question.

&gt;Oh neat. 

Condescending statement.

&gt;You used Strata, Cashmere, and Rakau? 

Rhetorical question. 

&gt;Awesome, except you boiled them for an hour and now there isn't a single person alive that'd be able to tell whether you lied and just used Nugget. Or any other hop for that matter.

Guess what? Personal opinion/statement, no question.

&gt;Are you the kind of person that goes into a nice steakhouse and insists on a well done steak?

Condescending, rhetorical question.

&gt;Cool. I've got a killer West Coast IPA you should try. It tastes bitter. You'll love it.

Yet another personal opinion/statement, no question.

&gt;This isn't a style. It's brewing laziness and it's disrespectful to the malt, yeast, water, and hops.

Personal opinion/statement, no question.

Where was your question again?

Yeah, I'll stick with my original reply.",beer

160,"I don't know anything about OEC, so I can't comment. on their beers. 

Many beers will be ""MARKEDLY different"" after six months.

Beer is always about personal preferences.

Beers don't get better with ages, they change. It's how someone interprets this change that is the key.

'Sours' covers a large range of beers and production techniques. Some suit aging, some don't. Again, personal preference. 

I can't see myself finding a reason to age low abv kettle sours, which is what most sours are these days, except for out of curiosity and/or education/training purposes. 

While spontaneous ferments, live sour beers, wild ales, mixed ferments, etc, fruited and unfruited, offer a lot more interest and potential for change, in my opinion. But again, it's all about personal preferences.

176,"I may have the chemistry wrong here, but I believe the two possible explanations are that 1.) The breweries water filtration wasn't right and I believe that would sometimes result in a high chlorine level in the beer that can come off as smokey to some or ""band-aid"" like to others or 2.) sometimes yeast's phenols can come off as ""smokey"" because one of the chemical components that arrives during fermentation is fusel (which fun fact is German for Bad liquor). People have varying levels of sensitivity to this that may or may not develop over time. I'm not familiar with most of the beers you mentioned but my guess is you are more sensitive to fusel.

The pubs in Ireland usually have two taps for Guinness...one tap handle is blue meaning the beer is ice cold for American taste, and the other tap handle is black for the native Irish who know that Guinness tastes best at cellar temperature.

Now that you’ve taken the plunge into vitamin G, I would heartily recommend that you be on the lookout for bottles that had recently been released to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Guinness in the US:

- Guinness Antwerpen Stout is based on the recipe for Guinness that was brewed exclusively for the Belgian market
- Guinness 200th Anniversary Export Stout

To answer your question: not really. The majority of the equipment you listed is for the beginning stages of making beer and fermenters are for allowing the beer to hangout with yeast for a bit of time. So the mill, brewhouse, filtration, canning/bottling lines can all be singular.

You need to let customers know about it, and at least estimate how long that will be. If your average time to ship is a week, then let me know. Maybe they only ship every two weeks due to COVID.

Their cans have really clean, distinctive designs with a minimum of text, and the brewery clearly knows how much packaging matters these days when shelf/cooler space is so crowded.

That said, during this crisis they're putting more beer into distro than they'd expected to, and they are adapting some of their labeling to be more distro-friendly.

Your perspective reads to me as though you shop primarily in the IPA market, at least it would make your argument make more sense to me.

Personally I got tired of finding by and large only IPAs everywhere and them all being dry hop blasted and 7% calorie monsters inevitably sold in 16oz cans. By the end of one my palate is blown and I'm full. Dry finished beers and low ABV beers are so much more refreshing and enjoyable in quantity or outdoors or both.

I think it's natural progression. Most people are drawn to the big and bold beers initially, but over time starts to gravitate towards subtler and more casual beers. Hell, just a few years ago, I wouldn't spend money on pilsners, and now I buy them all the time.",beer
39,"&gt; Lagers and pilsners are bad, too - most breweries here don't make them because they don't want to fool with lagering, or they turn them into IPLs or whatever that are WAY too hoppy and totally unbalanced, or they add a bunch of some kind of flavor or another and totally drown out everything else.

53,"Oh yeah, and they all should be doing good water prep.

The major associated costs generally aren’t in the treatment chemicals, though. They’re in payroll, time, and capital costs.

Somebody in the brewery had to take the time to properly test and treat the water, and some adjustments can require some time to equilibrate. If a brewery is very small and it’s just one or two brewers stretched thin, good water prep can be one of the first things to fall by the wayside.

If the brewery has very soft water, almost all the adjustments that may be needed are additive, but if the brewery has very hard water (or heavily chlorinated water, sulfurous water, etc), there may be significant subtractive steps in the preparation of their desired brewing waters. RO, ion exchange, etc all have very low marginal costs per gallon once installed, but the installation of these kinds of systems can be very expensive up front. Blending the tap water with distilled water delivered commercially is usually more expensive per gallon, but has basically no capital costs other than storage space.

Those are the general costs that I was getting at with the previous post. I know a fair number of brewers who get away with just some minor additive tweaks (largely because the water is pretty soft around where I live, with low chlorine, etc.) who would love a shiny new RO system, but have no budget for it at the moment.

For a Kölsch, brewers with very hard tap water will need to find a way to demineralize their water, and that can be expensive if they don’t already have it set up, or just too much trouble for them to bother.",beer

Yes, missing the specific date you hoped the package would arrive by is frustrating, as is their lackadaisical response and delay in providing it. I completely agree with all those things.  However, with the benefit of being 3rd party to all this, I would say those things are fairly minor IF the product was good.

It's also worth asking, did anyone other than you know about the birthday date? Was there ever anything more than an assumption on your part that would suggest the package would arrive in time?

  I also don't mind some play with the style, adding cherries, grapefruit, etc. Sometimes it ruins the beer, but when dine right....really tasty.",beer

195,"That’s because most American breweries make ales (using single infusion mash for the grains) and Germany/continental European breweries do lagering (using decoction mashing for grains). Both processes release different proteins and generally use different base grains. If you ever see a place that specializes in ales make anything German (save for a Kolsch or gose) be prepared for it to be sub-par. Single infusion mashing just can’t make good continental styles, no matter how hard the brewer tries. Sometimes it’s decent, or okay, but never great. That’s why American hefes suck, and also why American lagers have to use completely different grains (6-row, 2-row, corn and/or rice) than German lagers (Pilsner, Vienna, Munich malts). As a brewer, I cautiously try samples of German beer from brewers that usually make IPAs. Sometimes I’m surprised. But it’s rare. As much as I love trying new styles, American breweries simply don’t have the history or equipment to do German styles justice, and I’d just prefer they stick to what they’re good at and stick to beer made for their region/water/terroir than making sub-par recreations of styles not meant for American geography/climate. Just my 2-cents.",beer
196,Correct. Just like every other alcohol-related law. It's mandatory in NJ.,beer
197,"You're right, but I don't really get it.  I mean, on the hoppy vs malty spectrum, both wheat beers and most dark beers are on the malty side.  People that like hefes might not like dunkelweizens *better*, but they should still like them, at least absent preconceived notions.  

They (dark beers) have a reputation for being ""thick"", but I don't really get that at all.  I wonder how much of it is people tasting Guinness on nitro and reacting to the different carbonation.",beer

Dunkelweizens are dark hefeweizens, so they taste like a slightly sweeter, more malty hefe.  (IMO anyway)

I wish the U.S. would pick up a lot more of the Belgian styles such as dubels, tripels, farmhouse ales and Saison. Gueuze and lambic beers too. All of those beers are some of the most flavorful and incredible beers I’ve ever tried, and they’re often so outnumbered relative to just IPAs.

249,"Hop burn. This is a well known phenomenon among brewers. Some people love it, some people hate it. Basically, hazy IPAs use large quantities of hops with very high oil content. When the oils remain in suspension in the finished beer, it causes that itch in your throat. As a homebrewer, I find my hazy IPAs always have hop burn during the first week or two in the keg. After a few weeks of being cold in a keg, things settle to the bottom and the hop burn goes away.",beer

Preemptive edit: wait do you mean at breweries? I've never seen a brewery in Aus that doesn't list ABV but that's probably a culture thing as pubs dont have to so breweries (probably) dont have to either, but they do anyway.

I think too many US breweries consider Kolsch style beers as summer beers. It should be year round. I like extreme beers such as double IPA's and Belgian quads but for every big beer I drink, I drink ten others that are 4% - 7% ABV.

I'm sure in the Fredricksburg area you'd be able to find something pretty authentic. My idea of authentic is asking for leitungswasser and having the waiter sneer at you.

57,That’s the greatest Hefeweizen IMO. Masterpiece,beer
59,This is why I make a point to order Browns and ESB’s and the like when they pop up at my breweries.  :-)  I’m lucky that one of the closest to me focuses on malt forward guys.,beer
60,Rye beer is my choice.,beer
62,The Weihenstephaner hefeweizen is my favorite at one of my local bars. There's a nice German style Biergarten just a few miles from where I live. My favorite spot for a brew.,beer
63,"I mean, it's all relative. Like most aren't ""sweet"" but they aren't as dry as a lot of German and Czech offerings. Beers I don't like don't really stick to my mind, but Mama's Little Yella pils comes to mind.",beer
64,Challenge accepted! I’ll be taking a vacation in Florida later this year so I’ll have to make it a priority stop then,beer
65,Cantrip Kolsch from Bottle Logic is an awesome Kolsch.,beer
66,"That sounds about right, thanks",beer
67,"English Barleywine or Strong Ales. A few breweries nail those styles, more completely fuck them up, and most completely ignore them.",beer
68,Miel in /r/neworleansbeer makes some of the best Hefeweizens I’ve ever had. Maybe even better than Live Oak,beer
69,have you tried Pure Project murkshakes?,beer
70,Metropolitan in Chicago makes a real good one,beer
71,Have you tried the Sierra Nevada/Bitburger triple hopped lager collab? IMO it’s reminiscent of an IPL more than a regular lager,beer
72,Allagash White isn't a hefeweizen.,beer
73,"I don’t have trouble finding them. I love them and it’s a great style. Maybe it’s just because I trade pretty actively, I can see how someone who relies on distribution for their beer can be disappointed in the barleywine options. The west cost has better options for distro barleywines than other regions, B3K is incredible",beer
74,"IPL’s, man. So smooth and nice when done right, and I hardly ever see anyone actually put them out. Tropic of Thunder by Stone is the only major/nationally available one I can think of.

That and Black IPA’s- I love stouts, but having something with more bite that isn’t motor oil thick, super sweet or BBA would be nice.",beer
75,"Union in Baltimore has a schwarzbier as part of their core lineup, Blackwing, which is freaking awesome.",beer
76,[... Ya but.](https://youtu.be/uNy_MLr8mXA),beer
77,Machine House in Seattle is the only brewery I know that has a strong focus on cask ale,beer
78,And his axe!,beer
79,Plenty of good barleywines out there.,beer
80,Anything low ABV (&lt;4%),beer
81,Make that three!,beer
82,I've heard the term hop burn from many and used it myself. I think that's what you're referring to?,beer
83,"My last homebrew was an altbier.  Month and a half in the fermenter before kegging, probably still not long enough or cool enough to be considered proper ""lagering.""  Was still my favorite out of the 30+ batches over the years, was just nice and mild, easy drinking.

I'd be all about American craft breweries chilling out a little with the wild flavors.  It should be way cheaper for breweries to make simpler beers too.  Can I get a craft German style for like $2.50 instead of a wild style IPA for $5?",beer
84,"Fremont is a weird example, too, because they were difficult to get in the beginning, but unlike many other hype breweries, they flew under the radar for *years*, then the hype train smashed them, but they were already pretty big by that point (driven by good local sales of their flagships) and were easily able to scale. There's still a lot of demand for many of their special BA releases, but with their improved numbers and distro, I don't think many people are trying to flip it any more.",beer
85,💯 yes!,beer
86,Black label here in Denver does a pretty good job but that about it.,beer
87,Literally anything other than goddamn IPAs.,beer
88,I hear ya. At least you got a patio. Enjoy it and grill something good!,beer
89,Jester king is great. One of my favorite beers is Atrial Rubicite...I’ve never been to Altstadt so that needs to be on my list of visits,beer
90,Can't go wrong with a good ESB. My buddy and I have gotten pretty good at brewing over the years and it's often easier for us to brew up 10 gallons of a tasty ESB than to find a good one at the store.,beer
91,Will do...Austin sounds right up my alley. Any good places to get traditional German grub? Polish?,beer
92,"100% agree. “Cream” has very distinct flavor and texture associations, none of which are present in cream ale lol",beer
93,"It's a gluten allergy mate. I don't know where you are based but try the Vagabond from Brewdog, the Fantasma from Magic Rock, any beer that is listed Gluten free.

I know you might not have a gluten allergy with regular food, but you'd be surprised how sensitive a lot of people are with gluten in beer. Try it and see.",beer
94,Totally agree! Vitus is a year around staple in my fridge. Such a dangerous beer,beer
95,Amen as well,beer
96,100% agree with you. Cheers bro!,beer
97,"I’ve been living in Austin for 5 years, and I think we have the best beer scene in the state. You absolutely have to go to the hill country to have Jester King. You seem very knowledgeable so I’m sure you’re familiar with them. Altstadt is also hill country and male quality German brews. ABGB is making, in my opinion, the best pils/lagers in America (and have the medals to prove it).",beer
98,"A good pils is better than a good imperial, but I find so many bad pils that I trust a random imperial more than a random pils. Short's Spruce Pilsner is probably my favorite imperial pilsner",beer
99,"Yes please. Berliner Weiss’s that isn’t overly sour like a lot of modern versions, isn’t fruited and is a nice, low abv can get in my fridge.",beer
100,"Cuvee Rene is superb, well-priced, and often overlooked. The Special Blend is absolutely on par with the best gueuzes I've ever had, though that is now harder to get than regular Cantillon, 3F, even some Bokke.

Also, there's Lindemans lambic in *a lot* of the other producers' products mentioned here.",beer
101,They are very tasty indeed. The lost abbey makes some truly unique ones,beer
102,I'll keep an eye out when they start distributing to the Midwest.,beer
103,"Go to Austin, you've got Jester King and Live Oak, and so much more. Fredericksburg is a bit West of Austin. It was a German settlement, and there's kind of a German belt through Central Texas. Altstadt makes great German-style beers. They have a unique dialect of German in that part of the state, too.",beer
104,"Thanks, I always forget!",beer
105,I still buy anything from Weihenstephan whenever I see it around me. They don’t make a bad beer.,beer
106,The options at their brewery are amazing .. They bottle some beers but those aren't their best (as is likely true for a lot of breweries but still wanted to call it out for them),beer
107,I dig a regular pils more than an imperial... my favorite lately is from Buoy. Pretty much all of their stuff is solid.,beer
108,"Yup. And this situation is the overwhelming reason for why is beer nerds can’t get our worldly flavors here... it’s just not a good business decision to invest in making a world class Tripel, knowing you’ll move 10x the amount of joose-haze IPA which is cheaper to produce... very sad, but when you find a good one it is a gem. Cheers from Cali native in ATX! Great post btw",beer
109,There are at least two of us,beer
110,"No, I’m down I-70 in Columbia. Happened to be someplace yesterday that’s at the very edge of KC Bier’s distribution radius.",beer
111,Exhibit A in Framingham Mass make a nice kolsch if you’re in the north east.,beer
112,"I like Timmermans, however I've only have about 2 ounces of it, but enjoyed what I tasted. Will need to do a full 8-12 to get the full feel.",beer
113,"Are you in KC? I live about 10 blocks from KC Bier co, actually stopped by there an hour ago for Pils and Dunkel sixers to go.",beer
114,Hah! Pre-mixed shandy is one's favorite! At least do it yourself and add bitters you heathen!,beer
115,Oh definitely,beer
116,I love saisons. They are so tasty.,beer
117,Pizza port makes a great amber called “ chronic ale “ you definitely can’t only drink one!,beer
118,"As an Englishman in New York (woooo-oah!) my vote is for Real (cask-conditioned) Ale. American breweries have covered pretty much every style under the sun with varying degrees of success, but for some reason English-style cask ales just don’t get the love they deserve. I’m not even going to get into the politics of Real Ale vs Craft back home (hey CAMRA!). 

There’s still a huge stigma surrounding Real Ale as warmed-up, soapy piss water. It’s not a forgiving style at all - it doesn’t keep for long, doesn’t travel well and the flavours are quite nuanced so flaws are easily exposed...you can’t just inject another hop charge and hope nobody notices the diacetyl...

Which I guess is the issue; it’s too fussy a style (although Real Ale is a fairly broad church) and anything exported to these shores from the source is just not going to do it justice. I can’t imagine it being worth many brewers time to hone the style, especially where there’s money to be made...sigh.",beer
119,amber ales,beer
120,That’s a winner! I’ve literally only had one in my life and that was years back. I’d definitely like to revisit the style,beer
121,Wow! That sounds like an amazing experience. I’d have to definitely see that before I die,beer
122,Boulevard makes a good one imo.,beer
123,Man I got to make my way down to Texas again...it’s been a while! What part of Texas do you recommend?,beer
124,That’s wild. I just recently bought a couple bottles from a local restaurant and it is basically a perfect beverage.,beer
125,"For me it's Black IPA.

They're pretty uncommon (at least in the Northeast) but the few I've had I have really enjoyed. It's a mix of two styles that you'd think would be more popular but never seems to pick up steam. .

The last one I had was Night Swell by Heavy Seas. Unfortunately I never saw it again in the liquor stores near me (early December.)

Any time a brewery in Rhode Island or Massachusetts puts one out I definitely go and grab it.",beer
126,Ah I’m fortunate to live in Southern California. A couple breweries down here ( Bruery Terreux &amp; Beachwood Blendery ) make great lambic brews,beer
127,"They are traditionally organized as you would expect. Carnivale is like Mardi Gras in that it starts on the Twelfth Day of Christmas, but the heavy partying starts on the Thursday (Fauschentag) before Ash Wednesday, then they skip a day, and hold Geisterzug (ghost parade) on Saturday in a different neighborhood every year. They skip another day set aside for the Kinderzug (children’s parade) on Sunday. The biggest day is Rosenmontag (red Monday) with the biggest parade, with bands, antique wagons, and clubs marching in historic military uniforms, and for whatever reason, tractors, combines, and other farm implements. Instead of beads, they threw flowers to girls and candy for the kids, but once in a while, a unit would stop the parade and a member would hand a bouquet of flowers to a beautiful women or a senior lady that they spotted in the crowd. It was wholesome af. On the next day, Shrove Tuesday, they all stayed home and ate pancakes.

It was a singular experience.",beer
128,We wish there were more of you,beer
129,"As a consumer, if I am at a brewery with a brown ale, ESB, imperial pils, etc I always get it. I want to reward breweries that try something different, and 9 times out of 10 they're great! Much better than the brewery with 16 taps and 15 IPAs.",beer
130,Nothing beats a ice cold Hefeweizen during a cookout,beer
131,Huge German population in Texas I think is the root of it. We also make some of the best Pilsners and even Kolsch styles that I’ve had in the US,beer
132,KC Bier Co is so good.,beer
133,American lambics,beer
134,I know someone that was allergic to gluten and Corona was one of the few beers she could drink.,beer
135,Oh I will. Summertime is my hefe season.,beer
136,Give it a go again. Breweries nowadays tend to change the formulation on certain beers lately,beer
137,"Tbf, i don't know if they actually keep that data, or if it's simply a check against a database to validate the ID.",beer
138,"I agree, it's a great choice.  I also love Hacker Pschorr.",beer
139,temind them that german supermarkers carry bottles of combined coke/beer.,beer
140,"Shotgun Betty from Lonerider Brewing here in Raleigh NC is a great hefe.  When I was in a hefe phase, I was shocked to find anything so close to me.  Very clove and banana forward.  Haven't had in a year or so, will have to try again.",beer
141,Circus boy? Honestly it didn’t have any of the traditional Hefeweizen flavors,beer
142,Upvote for KC Bier Co.   this thread would be half of what it is if KC Bier was a National chain.   (Not that I want it to be),beer
143,Magic Hat hefe,beer
144,Ayinger Marzen is phenomenal. I look forward to it every year,beer
145,Hmm. Acid reflux disease?,beer
146,"My favorite beer is German märzen lager beers, so ... that.",beer
147,Interesting. Perhaps a certain hop variety? I have a friend I grew up with who used to absolutely drown himself in Bud but developed a beechwood allergy and now Miller Lite became his go to.,beer
148,Yup! They honestly think American craft beers peak is stone brewing and it’s truly sad.,beer
149,"yeah I don't know where the name came from because it kind of describes the opposite texture of what the bear has. Like if I was gonna describe any beer as ""creamy"" I'd reserve that for something like a nitro stout or something like Belhaven's nitro scotch ale",beer
150,Denver is my next work trip so I’ll definitely stop by. Can’t wait to buy some shrooms and have some weisbier!,beer
151,pilsner,beer
152,Almost finished off a 2L Growler of a classic Scottish Pale Ale from a local brewery. Think I am going to hit the Pilsners next!,beer
153,"Troegenator Doublebock is a great one. I'm a bit biased as it was my gateway to beer long, long ago, but I love it. I don't think I've had an American one that was better.",beer
154,Ahhh lucky you! Thank the beer gods for that,beer
155,"I've met more than a few Germans who just don't know anything about beer. They've either bought into the German superiority marketing angle or they think anything cheap is good and anything that isn't cheap is *bad*.  Some of those dudes had never had an American beer that wasn't Bud, Miller, Coors, or (North American) Corona.",beer
156,"100% agree on the Hefeweizen. If you can get your hands on it, try the Weißbier from Prost in Denver. Absolutely the best hefe I’ve ever had.",beer
157,Wow that would be great! Thanks man,beer
158,I’m from Cali but travel the US for work/pleasure. Man I hate when breweries turn staples into seasonal/ limit release beers,beer
159,"Yeah I get that. I had made peace with probably not being able to get an authentic Czech-style pilsner or draft rauchbier ever again when I moved to the States, so being able to get both at a local brewery is more than I dreamed of",beer
160,Hahaha wow! Nothing like a shard of glass piercing your boot! 😂😂😂 maybe one day I’d make the trek down to cologne again just to witness the madness,beer
161,Nice. I've been getting back into them recently. It's definitely an excellent compliment for the hotter weather.,beer
162,Dude I think cream ales are killing themselves with that name... it sounds so gross but then you have one and... it’s just a good clean beer.,beer
163,"No idea actually.  I don't think so though.  He's pretty local.  

Let me see if I can find some - it's a year rounder for him.  If I can, I'll drop you a line in a DM.",beer
164,"No, they're maybe 4°C",beer
165,"Austin Beerworks had a Schwartzbier as one of their four OG year-round beers... now it’s seasonal because nobody bought it 😞 not sure where you’re located but mentioned Live Oak so thought you may be near ATX (bless your heart for that comment too, live oak does an amazing hefe)",beer
166,"I was literally the only American at the Carnivale in Cologne in 2008. I wish I had a nickel for every German who said that I was the only American that they had ever seen at Carnivale, and most of them told me not to tell any other Americans about Carnivale because we had already ruined Oktoberfest, which is pure nonsense. I’ve only been to Oktoberfest once, and I saw very few other Americans, but yes, the Germans were much drunker than at Carnivale.

One of the funny things about Carnivale is that they refuse to serve the Kolsch in plastic...they only use plain traditional glass Kolsch stanges. At the end of each night the streets around the Heumarkt look like jagged ice from all the broken glass. In testimony to German punctuality, the huge metal street cleaner machines the size of zambonis start their engines at precisely midnight and god help any pedestrian in the way.",beer
167,Does he ship outside Texas? I’d love to try his weisbier,beer
168,"Most of my local breweries have been banging out pilsners like mad, and I'm all for it. They've been great so far. Really feels like summer when you're sippin on a crispyboi in nicer weather",beer
169,"Not answering your question OP, but if you can get ahold of it, Franconia (McKinney, TX) makes the best ""American"" Hefeweizen around.   I lived in Munich for two years and the first time I drank a Franconia Weizen it was like I had been transported back.   He also makes a Krystalweizen which seems to be a rarity here in the USA.

I put ""American"" in quotes because the owner is a German transplant and studied brewing over there.  They adhere to all the german purity standards so it's not really like other beers.",beer
170,I agree with Live Oak!,beer
171,Exactly! Everything doesn’t have to be based on alcohol content. Flavor over abv any day,beer
172,"Live Oak is the best in the US

New Glarus Dancing Man is another.",beer
173,Modern times make a passable berliner Weisse in fruitlands,beer
174,"All of the lower abv beers that don't sacrifice flavor. Grisette, dark mild, bitters, etc are all fantastic, full flavor beers at reasonable ""session"" strength.",beer
175,Just wish it was more wide spread or distributed I guess. I’d love to go to my local watering hole and have a great Hefeweizen and have an amazing Italian Pils as well.,beer
176,Precursor Pils and Waiting for a Sign DIPA.,beer
177,Stouts/posters tend to be very regional with each region having their own take. Kind of like IPAs IMO,beer
178,Berliner Weisse. It's my go-to summer session beer when I can find some.,beer
179,"I suppose the answer to this really depends on where you are in the US. I have had a respectable version of just about every beer style mentioned in this thread in Chicago, plus other unusual European styles such as grodziskie and grisette.",beer
180,Yards Brawler is a great dark mild out of Philly.,beer
181,I’ve never been a fan unfortunately. A little too bitter for the amount of alcohol in it IMO,beer
182,Exactly. The culture surrounding alcohol in the states is more about getting drunk than over in Europe. They tend to be more social drinkers,beer
183,"I tried many of their beers at Real Wild &amp; Woody.  They were nice, but nothing mind blowing like the barrel aged sours at AZW.",beer
184,Hefs and pilsners for sure.,beer
185,Probably or just amazing distributors!,beer
186,"That's very unusual, the brewers are rather meticulous.  I've never had a bad beer there.  Been spending at least $100 a week on their beer since the shut down, and have been patronizing since it opened.",beer
187,Laughing fox is a great Kristalweizen!,beer
188,"Seriously! I live in a decent sized city in Canada, and holy crap the selection within a 90 minute drive just blows me away",beer
189,"Whenever I see American Baltic Porter, I get a glimmer of hope that is almost always instantly snuffed out when I take the first sip. Duck Rabbit is the only American brewery that I feel produces a tasty Baltic Porter. All of the others that I’ve tasted seem like the brewer just slapped the name on regular Porter because they thought it sounded sexy or something.

One other possible exception is Crooked Stave’s Coffee Baltic Porter which is absolutely delicious, but the coffee overpowers any residual essence of being a Baltic Porter....typically American take, but in this case, I loved it.

Another style is Foreign Export Stout.",beer
190,"Man, I want a real grill so bad. I use a little Weber camping grill because our patio is tiny. It gets the job done but barely. Hoping I can get a real 4 burner kickass grill someday",beer

192,oh good answer,beer
193,Barley Wine!,beer
194,I'm in Georgia.,beer
195,Because most people do not want alcohol that weak.,beer
196,What's in the package? Mystery beers?,beer
197,"It was pretty amazing every time I had it! Definitely worth checking out if you’re ever in Philly. Not sure how some places get rare kegs from Europe, maybe the benefit of being on the coast.",beer
198,Oh absolutely!,beer
199,"New Glarus Dancing Man Wheat is a great American made German Hefe. Laughing Fox, Bubbler, &amp; Crack'd Wheat are all excellent too.",beer
200,"I went to Bissell Bros last fall! I loved Portland, hope to go back someday",beer
201,Goddamn. You're doing it right my man. Cheers to the grill!,beer
202,I guess Texas is the Germany of America! They must make the best Hefeweizens outside of Germany,beer
203,That's terrible. Stay strong man!,beer
204,Ah that I explains it!,beer
205,That sounds damn good. I just bought a bourbon BA milk stout from a local brewery in the PNW. Gonna crack that mofo tonight!,beer
206,Where did you find bell's expedition? I thought the release wasn't for another few months.,beer
207,Interesting! Carnivale sounds like a blast...I went to Germany during Oktoberfest and I had my fair share of drunks picking fights and literally talking to themselves in the streets,beer
208,"You should try Wrenhouse. They do a really great job, and try fun stuff",beer
209,"Talk Shit Friday! I like it. I still have a few hours of work to go but can't wait to crack some burrs tonight. I just got back from my local bottleshop and I bought some Kolschs, light lagers, a Vienna lager, and a couple bourbon BA stouts. Gonna be a good weekend boiyos!

As for fun - I've been hard at work on a new [beer YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClvsKb8Qi3V7lpmUh4X5kbA) (I know, I know) but guess what? It's not just another generic beer review channel. I have over 1k bottles in my cellar (not a flex, it's bad and I am not drinking them fast enough). I also have over 800 games on my PC, ridiculous! So I thought it would be really fun to pair the two.

I haven't really been able to reach the beer community yet as I'm fookin' old and I don't Insta too gud yet, but I'm working on it. But if y'all like video games and beer, I created my channel for the beer community and you. If you guys are bored, grab a beer, drink with me, and have a laugh.

TL;DR - Craft beer and video game [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClvsKb8Qi3V7lpmUh4X5kbA). Drink along!",beer
210,"It was a hazy pale ale. It can be caused by a number of things, O2, poor fermentation health, improper rest after fermentation, careless dry hop.

To me, having it seemed like the management forced it. Brewers would not want to present that beer to the public.",beer

214,"It’s a bit off the beaten path, but it’s still in the center city within walking distance of all of the Kolsch brewpubs in the Heumarkt area. 

I have very pleasant memories of visiting Paffgen during Carnivale. There was an ersatz Irish pub next door. All through every day of Carnivale, I never saw any drunk Germans until I walked in the Irish pub. They were loud, obnoxious and picking fights. I was so shocked that I asked a relatively sober one about it and he said that Germans aren’t typically used to whiskey.

Different members of the same family spell their surname differently and operate the definitely beautiful Pfaffen brewpub on the Heumarkt, but IMHO the Kolsch isn’t as good.",beer

223,"Had to google that.  Can't say I have ever in my life had a buttery tasting beer, anywhere.  Which beer was it?",beer
224,"Eh, getting the right banana/clove/ester/phenol balance can be tricky, which is why I don’t think many are very exceptional. Also, I’d say most brewers aren’t trying to make an American version of a hefeweizen, they’re just trying to make something flavor-neutral that ferments fast, and American hefeweizen/wheat ale satisfies that.

For the record I agree with you. German Hefeweizen is probably my favorite style, so the bland American wheats just hurt my soul.",beer
225,"Yes, downtown Flagstaff.  Pizzicletta has an oven there, too!",beer
226,Sweet!,beer
227,Triples. I recently had a Thai tripel from Colorado that was really good. But I dont see many others brewed in the US.,beer
228,Is it in Flagstaff?,beer
229,That tends to be a trend with limited run beers! I once stopped by my favorite bar every day to drink Vitus fresh off the tap until it ran out,beer

241,Flagstaff was such a beautiful place...stopped before I went to the South rim of the Grand Canyon,beer
242,Totally agree. Wish I could stop by a pub here in American and drink a beer and not feel guilty after,beer
244,I just wish we had more than a couple good ones...in all honesty they are extremely easy to brew but we have over looked them in favor hoppy beer styles. We definitely should expand our horizons. I am truly grateful for the Brewers who have noticed this trend and are slowly breaking it,beer
245,"The restaurant is tiny, but they serve the inside the brewery since it's adjacent.  I love Flagstaff.",beer
246,"If it is too expensive, don’t buy it. It would also behoove the brewery to go to market in a way that does not allow exploitation by bots.

I’m saying normal, healthy secondary is exactly the right number always. If you want less secondary sellers, stop buying secondary. If you don’t like the way the brewery goes to market with limited releases, stop patronizing that brewery.",beer

284,"Basically any and every German style.  American craft brewing LOVES big, wild flavors, and German styles are about balance and crispness.  90% of American breweries just don't get it.  For example, I agree with you about Hefeweizens - most American ones are all banana, because a loaf of banana bread fired at high velocity into your face is the only high-intensity flavor hefe yeast can produce.  Lagers and pilsners are bad, too - most breweries here don't make them because they don't want to fool with lagering, or they turn them into IPLs or whatever that are WAY too hoppy and totally unbalanced, or they add a bunch of some kind of flavor or another and totally drown out everything else.

There are a few exceptions, mainly breweries that are intentionally German-style (super excited to have picked up a couple KC Bier Co sixers yesterday), but seriously.  I don't know if it's residual hatred for adjunct lagers like Budweiser, or the Belgian influence via New Belgium being the kind of American brewing for a while there, or what, but it drives me crazy.

The only people cashing out regularly are those overbuying kettle sours, hazy IPA from the right breweries, and Florida stouts.

I think Cantillon gets the attention because of the interesting fruit and grape varietal blends and they have a lot of one off beers with low bottle counts which increases rarity.

Tilquin is a great blender, one of the first batches of gueze they released was among the best I can remember having.

De Cam is hit and miss for me, Bokke I haven't been able to try because of the hype :\",beer

The vast majority of releases in beer are attainable if you're willing to stand in line. I think it's very funny how many people complain about perfectly nabbable beers when there are things that are much bigger, like Supreme or some rarer sneakers where you will be finessed if you aren't the right person. What's more, most of these breweries have consistently upped their output each year they release something major. Some things are always going to be difficult to get for a variety of reasons, but most of the time these things get easier and easier to attain as time goes on.

I don't think your second part is entirely true - I imagine if they keep bringing the price up, it would drive away a good amount of locals.

My understanding is that there are certain beers (like kolsch perhaps?) that are top fermented (typically the defining characteristic of ale) but then 'lagered' which basically just means rested post fermentation. And there are other beers (baltic porter notably) which are bottom fermented (typical of lagers) but then not 'lagered'.

There's also steam beer/california common which are bottom fermented but at higher temperatures than is typical of lagers and may or may not be lagered.

Remember you can brew 5 gallons of a decent beer for under 20 dollars. That is cheaper than some of these limited edition beers.

102,"&gt;Here’s a question for the group: How do people feel about liquor stores doing this?
&gt;
&gt;The argument I’ve heard from shop owners is that the direct-to-consumer sales model has cut them out of the picture so they’re just working themselves back into the picture.

I don't see it being much different.  Buying something intended for consumer use and reselling for a profit.    Mostly, I don't care.  Breweries shouldn't have to sell at wholesale prices to a distributor when they get full retail by selling directly themselves.  It's also pretty easy to enforce limits if a brewery wants to do it.  If you're seeing people go through lines multiple times or buying stacks and stacks of cases, it's because the brewery made a business decision that they would rather sell quickly than make sure that everyone gets some.",beer

People bringing mules to releases and buying up inventory reselling/trading at heavy markup. It was shitty and made it impossible to try these beers unless you had significant expendable income or lived somewhere where you could get your own whales to trade.

In short i hate it.",beer

111,"It’s a bit different in some European countries that have a more storied and continuous brewing heritage than the US. There was no real traditional brewing culture worth preserving in the US, so the distinction between “craft” and mass-market beer is pretty clean. 

In countries like the UK, Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, the traditional brewing culture can sometimes clash a bit with “craft” brewers.

For example, traditional British “real ale” is served live from casks, giving it a very unique character. A lot of newer craft breweries are making very interesting beer that often isn’t served this way.

It would be a huge shame if cask ale faded from popularity, especially given the Herculean effort expended by committed brewers and tireless activists to keep real ale alive back in the dark days. 

But on the other hand, you can’t fault the new generation of craft brewers for wanting to create something new. So it’s a tricky situation.",beer

There are some liquor shops in Mexico City that sell beer that is ""imported"" (which is illegal since Monkish for sure doesn't distribute to Mexico) but you will not have a problem purchasing since once it crosses the border and is on sale at a liquor shop, its legal lol.

119,"Here was my response to the OP in another sub, 

There would be some people better placed, than me, to make a really informed comment, you know, those lucky bastards to live in that part of the world. But I'll give you my take.

There are some other great breweries and blenders, and most of them offer something interesting.

I really like Bokke, Tilquin and De Cam, alongside 3F and Cantillon for balance and consistency.

Tilquin, for me, is much easier to get than Bokke and De Cam, and as such, I've had them more often and would put it right up there next to 3F and Cantillon. He's also doing some really good fruit examples.

Bokke is insanely good and also insanely expansive, doing some really interesting fruit and flavour blending. I never get to see them though, except in some assholes pics!

The guy from De Cam is insane, doing pretty much everything himself, in this tiny set up. His beers are really solid, with some good fruit examples as well.

Had a few things from a brewery called 'Lambiek Fabriek' and they were really good and pretty cheap. Just wish I could get some over here.

Some of the others have some lovely beers, but they can lack that depth and consistency, which is probably where De Troch and Hanssens are at. Sometimes they are great, other times, not so much, it depends on the blend you get.

Boon's Black Lable offers really good value, as does Girardin Black label and their fruit offers. Lindemans Cuvee Rene Kriek is probably one of the best value lambics around.

And there are some insane small blenders out there. I had the best Kriek I've ever tried last time, from some tiny place. It beat out Lou Pepe and 3F's Schaerbeekse Kriek. Fuck, it was good!

Good question and I'd be interested to read others opinions.

Damn it, now I'm thirsty.",beer

132,"1. Beer trading generally is cool and a good way to try and share beer from out of market.

2. The secondary market is ok within reason, I don't see a big problem with people buying a readily available beer in one market and selling it for a slight markup to someone who has no access in another market. 

3. Purchasing a limited beer with the sole intention of reselling for profit is a dick move IMO. Especially if you employ tactics such as using mules/proxies/line looping etc.. to score additional bottles. Doing this simply deprives others who actually want to drink the beer. 

4. Beer trading unfortunately has been infected by the secondary resale market, and is much more cut-throat with people arguing over trades and trade values vs having a spirit of sharing beer. This also leads to people buying up limited bottles with the sole intention of trading them for other limited bottles at the highest value possible, this is barley better than just selling them IMO.

5. Another part of this is people buying up way more beer than they need. There is no reason to buy every limited barrel aged stout you can get your hands on as you can't reasonably drink them all. Many people over-buy because of FOMO and then just let these beers languish in their ""cellars"" for years before: 1.) drinking the beer well past its prime 2.) resorting to a ""cellar sale"" and unloading it. Either way it is a waste of good beer.  I also see people overbuy NEIPAs because they gotta try them all, then months later they have a fridge full of 3-6 month old hazy IPAs that they are looking to unload because no-one can reasonable drink them all alone. Breweries feed into this buy brewing new beers every week that are really just slightly different.",beer

The social element of being in a pub with other people. That's the reason I'll stay out all night talking with people, and end up having 10 pints.

No fucking way am I sitting in the house having 10 pints, for the taste.

Having a beer in a bar, or at a sporting event, or by a pool, or in a park on a hot day etc... is vastly different than just having one when you get home.

It's part of an experience.

242,"Hate to break it to you but covid-19 probably isn't going away in any year that ends with a 0,1,2,3. The vaccine trials now are very hopeful but we've only ever eradicated two diseases, our fastest vaccine development was four years for mumps. The vaccine will probably be effective like a flu shot is effective, meaning this thing will be around when kids born today are heading to pre school. There's also the problem of production and distribution, and frankly ignorant anti - vaxx keeping herd immunity out of reach.

I really wish the media and politicians would start listening to the medical community, and repeating realistic outcomes on this so people can plan their lives.

Now for some optimism. We'll probably have some much better treatments soon, easier at-home tests soon, contact tracing processes soon. That will help the economy including ski lifts stay open. But life is not getting back to normal in 12 months time.",beer

A beer historian gave us a presentation on beer history in our state and noted a lot of our historic breweries couldn't make it once Budweiser and other large breweries at the time came in and started buttering up the bars to carry their beer. That was decades ago, and I'm in a very prideful state (lots of support for craft these days!), so it's incredible how powerful those marketing tactics worked to turn our residents away from the beer they'd been drinking for decades prior. 

On top of how aggressive they are to destroy competition, many beer distributors are InBev or MillerCoors (or whatever they both go by these days) backed, so those beers will always be pushed by those distributors, plus the money is funneled in for marketing purposes or whatever that keep their brands on top everywhere. They also work with large chains to draw up beer sets and during this process it's very easy to just drop independent distributor's products from sets or local package brews if they don't represent them. 

They have fingers in all aspects of industry to ensure they remain on top. Easy to hate. I drink craft most of the time, and I take it further in that I try to buy from more independent distributors.

If you were involved for the last decade, you would easily be able to explain your perspective from then until now. Instead I've had to pull teeth.

Again you refer to this 'investing' as if you made it big then now suddenly you want to pull out? Is Nick using you to subsidize his pub? Do you think he genuinely needs you for that? Why haven't you pulled out already if that's the case?

I want you to pull up google maps and take a look at all those places you just mentioned in these recent threads. Then look at Floyds, and you tell me where you think people are going to go. It's obvious that you are not from the Region. Nobody cares about what's going on in Minneapolis or Iowa or Michigan or Wisconsin. Unlike them, Chicago is a world class city. Driving 45 mins from O'Hare or Midway to get to Floyds then spending the night at a hotel or Ubering back is more realistic than ever before, and there is no equivalent example you've given with any of your peers.  

I'm genuinely sorry you didn't grow up in or near Chicago, because then you would realize how little influence the midwest has over anything, and how unique and special it is to have something like Floyds exist. Floyds looks like someone ripped out a bar from Haight and Ashbury and planted it in the cultural wasteland that is everything in the midwest but Chicago. You can talk about quality of beer or taste as much as you like. They say the same things when I'm in AZ about Four Peaks because InBev bought them like they bought Goose Island. Hipster beer nerds here fell all over themselves into the same tropes. 'It doesn't taste the same. Boy they sure don't do it like they used to. The quality has really gone down.' And each and every one of them were full of shit. 

I had ZD on my 21st birthday, and a decade later I had it at some random bar last year and it tasted as good as it ever did. Is my palate not good enough to appreciate the changes? Do I just not know enough about beer? Or is it all nonsense that hipsters say to themselves so they feel valid?

* Full tasting sheet. Choose 100 to sample. They bottle in 2oz jars and ship out all 100 to each attendee. You get about 10 you sign up for and a bunch of random ones you've never heard of... Total comes to about 60 a person.


* Play an audio track that has crowd noise and every so often the *plink  plink.  plinkplinkplink* of a glass falling so people can cheer ""OOOOOOOOHHHH""  in the comfort of their own homes

* Pretzel necklace competition! (this one is actually unironically a decent idea)

They shipped me 10 beers and then they had an online stream with bands, cameos from famous people I'm sure someone recognized, and interviews with the breweries. I personally had a blast. Worth the $42 and got to try lots of different beers. The best part is only 2 of them were IPA's. It was like going to a bar but there was no line for the bathroom, the floor wasn't sticky and the only annoying drunk was myself. 

Point is I think the online festivals are a pretty good alternative. Sure it's not the same but its a great change from the last 3 months of netflix. 

As a side note the ""abnormal beer co."", Abnormalweiss was a favorite in the online chat, and my personal favorite. It was the first beer I have been truly impressed with for a long time.",beer

112,"1. The legal way would be to find a liquor store in that area that carries that beer and also ships beer to California, but there may not be any, especially if this beer is only sold direct from the brewery. Brusin-Ales used to be a good webshop to order beers from NC but sadly they closed.

2. The other option is beer trading or just asking someone in NC with access to the beer to buy it and ship it to you. Technically consumers cannot ship alcohol, but plenty of people do it anyway. As long as you pack it yourself and print the label at home you can just drop it off at UPS/Fedex no questions asked and it will get shipped. The label usually requires you to declare what it inside, people put things like olive oil, collectible glassware etc...",beer
113,"Your mileage may vary, but I can often fight off the desire for beer by drinking seltzer water.",beer
114,"Beer trading between individuals is a time honored illegal thing most hardcore beer people do. Reddit has removed all or almost all of the beer trading subs, as has Facebook. Unfortunately, most of the sites and ""communities"" you'd have to go through would require some vetting for you to get into. But places like Beer Advocate is easier to get into and might be able to help out. If this beer is profitable, you might be able to find someone selling it on My Beer Collectibles.",beer

119,"How is this virtual?  Can you request beers ahead and then open and drink them while online?

I think it would be cool if you could buy a ticket and fill out a request form and they would send you a box of beers to be drank along with the virtual event.  That could be a way for people that can’t travel to it to participate or try some things that they normally couldn’t.",beer
120,Seconded. Most breweries can only ship within state. Plenty of great CA beers can be delivered to your door so that’s a nice consolation prize.,beer
121,"It's kind of become synonymous with NEIPAs, but no it's not specific to them.  Nearly all NEIPAs are going to be dry hopped almost exclusively with very little or no hopping during the boil.  That's a big part of what sets them apart.  And plenty of them are very heavily dry hopped so they could certainly label them as DDH. 
 But dry hopping and double dry hopping was pretty common practice in the IBU war heyday of the West Coast IPA too, and it's been around for decades before that.",beer
122,"It is not legal, but people do it.  You will have to find someone local to buy it and ship it to you.

You do have plenty of excellent IPA options in Cali, so maybe find something he likes locally?  Russian River?  Monkish?",beer
123,"Kombucha is good. A little pricey, but it has the bubbles and slight sour/bitterness that sets it apart from soda.",beer
124,"&gt; The event is still in planning, but experiences will likely include beer tastings, conversations with brewers, local brewery activations, and at-home beer and food pairing deliveries.

Hope they do a good job of it, if they do it right there is still potential for it to be a pretty awesome experience and for them to still make that money.  

A lot of the online festivals I've seen have been frustrating in what they offer.  Basically pay full ticket price to get a growler of one beer or maybe a selection of 5-10 or so cans of beers from a pretty limited set of options paired up with some zoom meeting type deal with breweries.  Full price for most festivals I've been to usually get you 20 or so sampling tickets, and nobody ever enforces the tickets.  You also get to take your pick from hundreds if not thousands of different beers.  

I'm not sure what the easy solution is, if I get 30 beers they can't really send me 30 one or two ounce samples.  It'll probably going to come in 12 or 16 ounce cans and clearly that is way more than I'd be drinking at the festival.  There has to be some kind of happy medium.  The variety is a big part of what makes the festivals worthwhile to me and I can't really justify a hundred bucks for ten cans of beer.  Even if it's stuff I can't get locally, there's just too much great stuff that I can get locally.  And while brewery talks are cool I can probably have a better time in a zoom meeting with my friends drinking whatever is in the fridge and actually being able to talk to them as opposed to just listening or taking part in a Q&amp;A.",beer

132,When I was under 21 I liked non alcoholic beer. There were many stores around me that had NA beer and I bought from quite a few of them. I was only asked to give ID a couple times. If you have more than one store around that sells it then chances are you will be fine.,beer

Green Flashes issues was a big eye opener for a lot of breweries in my opinion. I think breweries will start to become more hyper regionalized in the future, they can remain readily available to consumers but drive hype up to those just outside the area.

Semi-related, I've been pretty interested in the effects Untappd has on our beer consumption and lust for specific beers. I'm a little surprised there isn't more discussion about it given how prevalent the app is among folks at hyped breweries and haze houses.",beer
184,"Again, this means nothing. Why would you chime in for the validation of being a 'passive investor' but don't want to explain anything?

It was a 'bloodbath' and you're saying this based off of what? Only numbers that you know? Please. Was the pub suddenly a ghost town over the last two years and the world missed it? What regulations specifically made the pub less profitable? You don't have to give specifics for others to know you're an insider. No offense, but I think you're full of it. Either you've not invested like you claim, or you have and you've extrapolated your own perspective likely after a bitter experience or two as explanation for their supposed decline. Either way, I can't take you seriously with what little you've presented.

According to restaurant guys, 'it costs twice as much per employee as it did 10 years ago', and this is supposed to be a contributing reason the pub side is a 'bloodbath'? One I don't like this take because it implies that paying employees isn't worth it beyond doing it as cheaply as possible and two, by that logic couldn't you just offer them a paycut? Why go with the whole furlough? And what indications were around that they were reducing staff in any of their operations at all before the virus? If it was such a 'bloodbath', you don't think NWI Times or even the ChiTrib would've picked up on it? 

And I'm saying all this under your already very generous assumption that the pub side has lost whatever it was that made them profitable, desirable. Even if the pub itself never made a dime, and I seriously doubt that even considering your timeline, they make more than enough in retail sales and through distributors that they can subsidize their physical location, which they've already been doing. Oh and Bells and Founders have made dramatically deeper cuts to their staffs then Floyds. I don't think Floyds has let go anyone from the brewing or distribution side unlike their peers, and even announcing plans to not reopen the pub in May means they are way more resilient than when their peers closed. And nobody cares about Iowa or Toppling Goliath. I'm sure they have great beer, but nobody is going to visit there ever. None of your comparisons hold up.",beer

It was well known among insiders in the beer business years before they sold that they were quietly shopping for deals, their valuation was estimated to be nearing $3bill after the BP deal closed and they absolutely tried to cash in. The only reason it took them so long was because valuations imploded after the BP deal didn't work out for Constellation.

Frankly, It left a really cynical feeling with a lot of industry insiders who watched them publicly state they had absolutely 0 interest in selling, while we all knew they were actually actively courting buyers.

*Right Now* yes, but in steady-state I'm sure it's profitable. Corporate valuations aren't going to be looking at profitability now -- just look at the stock market, it's the same place it was 6 months ago. All COVID-related expenses and foregone revenue is going to end up as an EBITDA addback.

&gt;a new buyer may have no such appetite for that short term complexity. Even if the brewhouse was profitable before, a new buyer would have a high degree of uncertainty re: the on-prem hospitality industry as a whole, therefore wanting their purchase target to shed such assets ahead of the sale.

If they don't want to operate a brewpub or on-premise operation, then they'll just stop operating it  (and potentially create an opportunity to write down the asset). From that perspective, if you don't want it, it makes no difference whatsoever if the buyer or seller is the one to do it. However, if the seller shuts it down early, then you've destroyed option value, which even if the operation was breakeven would impact the valuation negatively. 

I work in Private Equity and we see this stuff all the time... having other operations, even if they're unprofitable, can open up a lot of opportunities and increases value, even if the plan is to shut them down, sell them, etc.

&gt;If goose island was being acquired by Inbev today, do you really think they'd be interested in a downtown brewpub that cant fully operate and has downtown RE overhead? I doubt it.

We can look at exactly what they did do -- which was to open a new, bigger, fancier brewpub years after the acquisition. It was a massive renovation and buildout. So, yes. I don't think they would even consider the current lock down conditions in that calculus. 

&gt;I was just remarking that several times recently, when a big craft brewer comes out and vehemently denies rumors of they have often been proven to be full of it.

That's just availability bias.

There's absolutely a scenario where, if 3F wasn't about to sell, they'd eat the loss for the short-medium term on their brewpub operation, with plans to reopen down the line, but a new buyer may have no such appetite for that short term complexity.

With regards to Lagunitas, I fail to see how their brewpub operation has anything to do with what I was referencing?  I was just remarking that several times recently, when a big craft brewer comes out and vehemently denies rumors of they have often been proven to be full of it.

This doesn't make any logical sense. Is the brewpub profitable? If yes, then it's worth a positive amount of money in a sale scenario. If no, they would likely close it in both a sale and no-sale scenario because it's losing money. 

Lagunitas has a MASSIVE brewpub operation at their Chicago brewery. Goose Island, too. Selling a share of your brewery doesn't mean the brewpub goes away.

Also, the reason that there is speculation on breweries selling is that none of them have a very strong balance sheet. In a pandemic, they could find themselves insolvent and unable to secure bank financing. The only other option is an equity partner, which is a ""sale"", whether that's minority, majority, or entirety.",beer
247,I'm not going to name the employee. But it is someone in management and it came from Nick himself.,beer
248,"&gt; I spoke with one of their employees and they are NOT going to reopen the brewpub ever

First, I doubt even the Floyds can tell you with certainty what is going to happen. Even so, according to the article, ""The pub, which can accommodate 70 people in about 2,000 square feet, will not reopen 'until it’s safe to operate again,' Floyd said. ... Floyd said he plans to eventually reopen the brewpub or a new taproom"" suggesting that ownership is very much open to resuming operations in the future and planning to do so. 

Second, whatever level of information ownership has, you can be damn sure ""one of their employees"" doesn't have the full story. Staff was completely surprised on Monday that they were getting furloughed; they couldn't have told you what was going to happen *that day.* Do you consider any of them to be a reliable source for what's going to happen in 2 weeks, 2 months, or 2 years? 

Let's listen to the people making the decisions, who are saying that it's closed now, they plan to reopen it, and keep in mind that while it's the best info we've got, any of that can change at any time.",beer
249,"Closed indefinitely, as far as employees are concerned I can see them seeing no difference between that and permanently because they are losing their jobs and will need to look for new ones.

Edit: Looks like on their Brew Pub’s IG, they posted that they “do not have immediate plans to reopen the Brew Pub” and that they have “put [their] plans to expand the brewpub on hold”. While that certainly doesn’t look good, it also doesn’t mean that they are closing the doors on the Brew Pub “permanently”; looks as though they are leaving themselves the option to reopen down the road if they wanted to.

It was exactly the same with Lagunitas, just like it was with New Belgium....both those brands were absolutely definitive that they would never sell, despite industry rumors of them looking for buyers for years ahead of the sales.  It was common knowledge when I was in the industry that New Belgium wanted to sell for several years, but couldn't get the offer they wanted after the BP deal closed.

Likely people are confused  because many smaller breweries operate solely as a brewpub and nothing more. 

Anyone familiar with Three Floyds knows the brewpub and brewery as a whole are separate things. They have separate investors just for the brewpub side. And also have separate social media accounts for the brewpub, vs the brewery. But I don't expect everyone to know that.

Still a brewpub is the restaurant side not the production side. This is only talking about the brewpub itself (restaraunt &amp; taproom). The production side, distribution side, to-go kiosk/curbside pickup side etc.. are all still operational.",beer

I made another [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/gnbvgw/three_floyds_closes_brewpub_indefinitely_due_to/fr93rkp/?context=3) explaining what I think they'll do. The reason you can find beer in Kentucky is because they just opened a 2nd brewery last year specifically for that reason since they've been getting better at influencing the statehouse over the years. That's different than the pub.

Those cans are going to fund their touristy type things. For the longest time it was Chicago-based tourism fueled by Beer Advocate, Rate Beer and co. and that genuinely crowded out locals from enjoying the pub. I know this because I grew up in Lake County and was born in Munster, so trust me when I say that even now, there are no nearby breweries or bars on par with Floyds in terms of pub experience, availability of product, or importance to community. All of that was for Chicago like maybe Goose Island. That wasn't a thing in Indiana and certainly not in Munster. Floyds made it a thing and were way ahead of the rest of the state. Many would argue they were solely responsible for making Munster fashionable outside of being a commuter town for white-collar Chicago tax dodgers and a handful of union remnants.

In the 90s they were begging people to come in for tours and give the beer away, but since mid-late 2000s they've been making a killing. Now they sell Zombie Dust at Wrigley Field. It's to the point where the pub is a trinket and has been for a while, yet both tourists and locals alike still want it for the same reasons they always did. And those are: 1) It's genuinely worth the trip, 2) If you are a local, when I say local I mean on the Indiana side, there are few better options if you want to enjoy something world class in your backyard.",beer

FFF was huge when craft beer really started to take off, like 2011-2013, they made a above average product that the market didn’t offer then. Now tons of places have opened up around Chicagoland and driving all the way out to Munster isn’t worth it as much, especially when you have good if not better beer closer to you that doesn’t cost as much as three Floyds does. Also at times FFF has been a little behind on the trends too. 

They also have significantly amped up production, they used to be very difficult to find, and if a place did get it, they would usually run out of it within hours. So if you wanted to get their beer, your best bet was to go out to their taproom and either get it in the taproom or to go.

Choices I think have a lot to do with it. FFF is a bit of a journey if you’re coming from Illinois which i assume is a good chunk of their business. With all the places opening up around Chicago and the suburbs, going all the way out to Munster just isn’t as worth it as it was before. For those not from the area, getting to Munster isn’t very easy to get to from the suburbs and just flat out a pain the ass if you’re coming from the city. 

Another thing too is Availability, they’re not hard to find at all anymore. 5-6 years ago they were kind of a “whale” to come by. I can find them at gas stations now  regularly.

58,"&gt; The Brewpub went from being insanely profitable to a money loser in the past two years. 

Ok, how? This answers nothing. What made it profitable, and why is that no longer so?

I was born in the town they’re based. Their beer is more expensive bought at the brewery then at the store or often at other bars. For at least the last 10 years the pub has drawn overflow capacity weekend after weekend from Chicago beer tourists and a handful of hipster locals who want to have a nice night without driving to the city. No regulations alone can change this dynamic. I’m not saying it’s you’re fault but there’s a lot you’re leaving out.",beer

It was weird ordering food, weird ordering beers.  I recall trying to get from the restaurant area to the spot where you order bottles to go (different areas).  An employee stopped us, couldn't believe we were trying to just walk over there.  Made us feel bad about it.  Had us walk outside, then back in - yet you could just walk over there.  No signs, no barriers to indicate any of this.  Very strange.  And I'm a very easy going and quiet person - it's not like I was being an asshole while there.

He wrote a number of books which are all quite exceptional. There’s also a (posthumous) documentary about Jackson, which I believe is also called The Beer Hunter.",beer

Founder's Centennial is one I would consider solid, Bell's Two Hearted is GREAT.",beer
75,"I actually researched a bit more after reading this and decided to try it myself.

Bought a cheap dispenser and packets of N2 gas capsules (usually marketed for coldbrew coffe or cocktails).

Poured in some cheap imperial stout and it worked wonders. I cooled it in the frodge, poured in the container, added nitro, shook, waited 3 minutes and poured. 

Probably should have let the beer settle for a bit longer before sealing the dispenser, because it had too much carbonation and the cascading effect lasted for almost 4 minutes and produced a really thick head. Visually the effect looked pretty much like a pour from an actual nitro tap. The body of the beer changed a lot - it became fuller and creamier while losing most of the carbonation. Very similar to a guiness. In the beginning the bubbles were a bit bigger than in a pour you get on tap in a bar, but they popped fairly quickly and only the small ones remained lasted for the rest of the time.

Overall I am very satisfied and will be using this to serve my homebrews that are naturally lower in carbonation (stouts, porters, brown ales,...). I also tried coldbrew coffe, iced tea and cocktails and it does wonders for that as well. Definitely recommend it as it is a very cheap but a very good home solution. If you change cartridges to regular N2O ones you can also make whipped cream or you can get CO2 ones to make sodas.

It is worth playing around with different tips that come with your dispenser and see which ones work the best for you. I also got some good results when I added two N2 capsules instead of just one (it profuced a bigger creamier body and head). 

If you wanna get serious you can get dispensers designed for nitro drinks that have a special diffuser tip similar to a stout faucet. These will most likely make the bubbles smaller and bring you one step closer to a proper pour.",beer

It will be a totally different taste (hoppy and tart) but not similar alcohol content to what you are used to. I was amazed at the distribution of this (formerly) regional US beer across Europe when I was there a couple years ago. In Copenhagen I was at a bar with four taps, and one was this beer. I live a few hours drive from the brewery and it’s a well-regarded version of the “session IPA.”  Session meaning it isn’t 7% alcohol like many IPAs. Hence the “All Day” name.",beer

DLD alone brings people from around the world and I’m sure they see a ton of foot traffic from out of towners (guilty) on a regular basis, so they are likely being very cautious. 

And while we are on the subject, just because shelter in place regulations have been lifted, doesn’t mean all of everything is just going to spring open without a single thought as to how to move forward with operations safely. It sucks for the people who work at places like the 3F pub or any other place that will remained closed until things are sorted out, but this is just how it’s going to be for a while. I personally applaud places like 3F for staying closed if they think it is within the best interest of their staff and the public’s health.",beer

* Hops. They're a flower from a vine, and some people are allergic to them. Some people are allergic to some varieties but not others.
* Gluten. Most beers come from gluten-bearing grains, which means all of the gluten family of proteins and whatever. If you're sensitive to gluten that could be an absolute dealbreaker.
* Yeast. Some amount of brewer's yeast is still in there no matter how they post-process the beer.
* Esters and phenols. Many yeast strains produce these as part of the ""characteristic"" profile of the strain and some beer styles depend on fairly high amounts of them.
* Other alcohols. So-called ""higher"" alcohols such as fusels, methanol, and the like can be produced, too, in minute quantities. Some people are extremely sensitive to \*any\* quantity of these.

So, there's a lot going on. If you know you eat or drink other things that have higher amounts of one or another of these things you can start to narrow it down. I, personally, sometimes get a mild headache / nausea from the first beer but then cure it with the rest of the beers.",beer

For instance, Yuengling has breweries in both Pennsylvania and Florida. Despite efforts to make beers taste consistent, sometimes they don't. Shipping of beer can effect taste due to the toll time and temperature fluctuations can take on the beer, especially when shipping internationally. That said, some international brands produce completely different versions of their beers for export than they serve locally for all sorts of reasons like ABV adjustments or to try to cater to different tastes or simply to produce more in bulk. Some export beers are produced in different breweries than the local version. And some American ""imports"" are even American produced versions of foreign brands.

The cans they have there are pretty varied and if say a good starting place. If you head to Morrison's I'd recommend picking up some Northern Monk cans as most of their stuff is delicious. It's also a good idea to try and check out some local suppliers in your area. Not only that but there are some bars that specifically stock beer that rotates on a weekly basis. I know with the whole lockdown thing that might be a little hard but if they're like my local one they do have cans and bottles in and are allowing delivery or even allowing you to go with your own container for them to fill it from the Keg.

For specific suggestions:

Newer World: Northern Monk
,Juice Forsyth: Brew York

70,"Do you have a sulfite sensitivity/allergy? Unfortunately many breweries are starting to add sulfites to stabilize their beer. I already couldn’t drink wine because of it and it looks like it’s creeping its way into the brewing industry. I know that juicy IPAs can be unstable and prone to oxidation. A way to combat this is the addition of small amounts of potassium metabisulfite, which is an anti oxidant. And also a pretty common allergen.",beer
71,"Could be certain yeast strains as well. I cannot drink beers fermented with belgian yeast (unless they’re fermented with brett and or lactobacillus as well-Brett seems to chew up all the phenols). Something about the phenols that are produced by those strains gives me terrible reflux and stuffiness. It’s not fun, I hope you figure it out.",beer

73,"&gt;A proper Belgian blonde is crisp and refreshing.

Where is ""refreshing"" in the brief? 

Refreshing isn't synonymous with ""light and crisp.""

What Belgian Blonde would you consider to be ""light and crisp?""

What Belgian Tripel would you consider to be ""light and crisp?""

I'm not sure how many people would look at styles like Belgian Blondes and Tripels, those designed to have full mouthfeel, to help hold 6+% abv, with ester and phenolic characters, as light or crisp. 

People are more likely to be surprised at the rich, full flavour and mouthfeel of Belgian Blondes, Saison and Tripels, given their relatively pale colour. 

Belgian Blondes and Tripel are a great education tool to show that colour doesn't equate to less flavour and lover abv. I use them in the exact opposite way to your suggestion of ""light and crisp.""

Now if refreshing was added as part of the brief, yeah, maybe the right Saison, especially something like a Grisette.

&gt;What, you wanted me to answer Kölsch like everyone else? The OP wanted alternatives.

Well, yes, a Kölsch would fit the brief of ""light and crisp.""

Why do you think people were putting forward Kölsch, etc. as options? Not an IPA, not a pilsner, not super hoppy, light, crisp. 

I didn't say not to offer suggestions.

The styles you offered are great. 

All I said was ""Not sure that any three of those fit the ""light and crisp"" profile.""

You have offered up suggestions that you like, which is fine. I only comment on one aspect of the OP's post.

The OP might very well love your suggestions, I only commented that your suggestions didn't fit the ""crisp and light"" aspect. 

If you had have actually looked at the OP, you could have said that the OP wrote,"" anything other than super hoppy beer,"" and that your suggestions could be an interesting option. But that's not what you are trying to argue. 

&gt;If you are not refreshed by a crispy Duvel then you are the problem.

I love Duvel. Visited the brewery last year actually. Had a ball and was very well looked after. 

Where is Duvel in your selection of Blonde, Saison and Tripel?

Seems to me that if you wanted to offer up Duvel, maybe you should have said Duvel or added Strong Belgian Golden Ale as an option.

Here are just a few examples of the way Duvel is categories -

2) Another thing that changes is your palate and interests. The things we look for in beer evolves over time based on personal and industry trends.

Must be cost saving, probably concern that no one will buy light, so force the change on the main brand.",beer

I don't work in the industry, so I too welcome an inside look, but I know heading into the summertime where I am, I don't mind lighter brews. Though a lot of craft breweries just seem to add a new beer, rather than neuter the flagships. 

Probably just the money though

Growlers are really a crappy vessel for beer since no matter what you do it is being exposed to oxygen and wont' stay fresh like a professional bottling or canning line.

There are some ways to improve it such as doing a CO2 purge, and using a counter pressure filler to help reduce the amount of oxygen the beer is exposed to, that may buy you a few more days of freshness. But again, once open it should be consumed in 24 hours.

Some styles can hold up longer if they can deal with a little bit of oxidation and loss of carbonation (such as large stouts).",beer

The lid is a simple twist on lid with a sort of padded squishy top inside to try and make it as airtight as possible. It should definitely be capped when it’s given to you, and you should be given a fresh lid every fill. Also, in my experience the window for enjoying a growler fill at peak freshness would be consuming it within threeish days of the fill.",beer
